# Minimal Wastage Solution
This is a minimal wastage solution code for the minimum wastage of villa-boards for wall lining. 

## About

Villa- boards come in default sizes and need to be cut down to some
specific lengths and breadths to fill the wall. 
This might lead to alot of wastage and loss. So, the solution for this problem would be to find 
the closest multiple of a given height and breadth of a wall. 

## How to use?
'''python
python main.py
'''
The user is then propmted to enter the length and the breadth. 
```bash
Enter length: 1700
Enter breadth: 1100
```
The output will be deisplayed thereafter.
```bash
--------------------------------
Minimal Shortage Length: 1*1800
--------------------------------
Minimal Shortage Breadth: 1*1200
```
