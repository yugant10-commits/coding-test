# Merchants Guide to Galaxy Trading
This program cinverts number and units of another galaxy to the money and resources from the earth.

## About

You decided to give up on earth after the latest financial collapse left 99.99% of the
earth's population with 0.01% of the wealth. Luckily, with the scant sum of money that
is left in your account, you are able to afford to rent a spaceship, leave earth, and fly all
over the galaxy to sell common metals and dirt (which apparently is worth a lot).
Buying and selling over the galaxy requires you to convert numbers and units, and you
decided to write a program to help you.
The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention to the
roman numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate translation
between them.
